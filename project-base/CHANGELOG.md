- it is no longer needed to redeclare feed plugin's implementations of `FeedConfigInterface` in `services.yml` (@vitek-rostislav)
    - decision about providing proper instance of `FeedItemRepositoryInterface` is made in `FeedConfigFacade`
- FeedConfigRepository renamed to [`FeedConfigRegistry`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Model/Feed/FeedConfigRegistry.php) (@MattCzerner)
    - it is not fetching data from Doctrine as other repositories, it only serves as a container for registering services of specific type
    - similar to [`PluginDataFixtureRegistry`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Component/Plugin/PluginDataFixtureRegistry.php) or [`PluginCrudExtensionRegistry`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Component/Plugin/PluginCrudExtensionRegistry.php)
- `UknownPluginDataFixtureException` renamed to [`UnknownPluginCrudExtensionTypeException`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Component/Plugin/Exception/UnknownPluginCrudExtensionTypeException.php) because of a typo (@MattCzerner)
- [`FeedConfigRegistry`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Model/Feed/FeedConfigRegistry.php) now contains all FeedConfigs in one array (indexed by type) (@vitek-rostislav)
    - definition and assertion of known feed configs types moved from [`RegisterProductFeedConfigsCompilerPass`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/DependencyInjection/Compiler/RegisterProductFeedConfigsCompilerPass.php) to [`FeedConfigRegistry`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Model/Feed/FeedConfigRegistry.php)
    - changed message and arguments of [`UnknownFeedConfigTypeException`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Model/Feed/Exception/UnknownFeedConfigTypeException.php)
- renamed methods working with standard feeds only to be more expressive (@PetrHeinz)

- sender email for error reporting is now configured in [`parameters.yml.dist`](app/config/parameters.yml.dist) (@vitek-rostislav)
- reimplemented [`CategoriesType`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Form/CategoriesType.php) (@Petr Heinz)
    - it now extends `CollectionType` instead of `ChoiceType`
    - it loads only those categories that are needed to show all selected categories in a tree, not all of them
    - collapsed categories can be loaded via AJAX
- [`CategoryRepository::findById()`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Model/Category/CategoryRepository.php) now uses `find()` method of Doctrine repository instead of query builder so it can use cached results (@PetrHeinz)
- it is possible to mention occurrences of an image size in [`images.yml`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Resources/config/images.yml) (@PetrHeinz)
    - previously they were directly in [`ImageController`](src/Shopsys/ShopBundle/Controller/Admin/ImageController.php)
    - they are not translatable anymore (too hard to maintain)

### Removed
- email for error reporting removed from [`parameters_test.yml.dist`](app/config/parameters_test.yml.dist) (@vitek-rostislav)
- removed unused private properties from classes (@PetrHeinz)
- removed `CategoriesTypeTransformerFactory` (@PetrHeinz)
    - the `CategoriesTypeTransformer` can be fully autowired after deletion of `$domainId`

    - fixes false negatives of acceptance test [`PromoCodeInlineEditCest::testPromoCodeCreate()`](tests/ShopBundle/Acceptance/acceptance/PromoCodeInlineEditCest.php)
